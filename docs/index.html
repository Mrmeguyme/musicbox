<h1>Music Box Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Installation</h3>
    <h3>Libraries / Python</h3>

    <p>The following libraries are required for the music box:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mutagen</li>
<li>PyGame</li>
</ul>

<p>These libraries can be installed through a few simple commands.</p>

    <p style="background-color: lightgrey;">> pip install mutagen</p>

    <p style="background-color: lightgrey;">> pip install pygame</p>
<p>These commands require python, Which can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure Python 3 is downloaded, as it is required for the program to run correctly.</p>

<h3>Program Time</h3>

<p>Next, download the program, and extract it to a folder of your choosing. Run either setup.bat or setup.sh depending on whether you run a windows machine or a linux machine. This will prompt you to press any key, which when pressed will execute the program.

    When executing the program from now on, execute it from run.bat.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

    <p>if the program won't start, try typing</p>

    <p style="background-color: lightgrey;">> python Main.py build</p>
    <p>into your command line to build the program.</p>
